  <!-- JAVASCRIPT REFERENCE VS COPY
  Fundamental to understanding how JavaScript works.
  More often than not, this is a source of a lot of bugs because people don't understand
  what the difference between a REFERENCE and a COPY is, especially when you get into nested data. -->

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100
    // We get '200 100' because the value of 'age' (200) goes into the variable at the same time.
    // That works the same way with strings:
    let name = 'wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Wes Wes

    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // wesley Wes

    // So, the vaules of strings, numbers and booleans go into it. And if you change the original one,
    // it's okay. It's not going to update the other one.


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']  ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // If we look in the console and type 'team', we'll se 'Lux' is the last one.


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // But if we look at the original array, 'players', IT ALSO HAS 'Lux' NOW.
    // So what happened?
    // Well, it's because we updated 'team'. And 'team' is NOT the array.
    // 'team' is just a REFERENCE to the original array ('players').
    // So when you edit that original array (when you update any of the arrays),
    // it's always going to go back to the REFERENCE where it was,
    // which is NOT THE SAME as what we did above with strings, numbers and booleans.

    // SO: If you update and array, it will always reference back.


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // So what we need to do is to make a copy, rather than an actual reference.
    // And there are a couple of ways that we can make a copy of an array:

    // 1. Use 'slice()'
    // 'players.slice()' --> this will just return the entire array.
    // Generally, you do something like 'players.slice(2,3)', and it will give you one element ["Ryan"],
    // whereas the original array is untouched.

    // But, what 'slice' will do if you pass it nothing, is it will take a copy of the actual array
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // 2. Another thing people do is to create a new (empty) array and concat the existing array in.
    // and this will just concat all of the items from that 'players' array into the empty array.
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // 3. Use the new ES6 Spread Operator.
    // So, you create a new array, and you SPREAD into that array ('players').
    // And what a SPREAD will do, is it will take every item out of your iterable
    // and put it into the containing array ('players') (although we can also use SPREAD to 'spread' into a function).
    const team4 = [...players];

    team[3] = 'hee haw';
    console.log(team4); // [ "Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "hee haw" ]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // So if we go to the 'players' array, it remains untouched.

    // 4. Use 'from()' and pass in the 'players' array.
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // And if you update 'team5', e.g: team5[3] = 'cool',
    // it will be updated, while the original 'players' array remains untouched.

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object:

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // --> You can NOT do this,
    // because if you do something like this:
    captain.number = 99; // ...then 'person' is now 99:

    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      number: 99
    };

    // So, even though 'person' should be 80, and we just update the number to 99,
    // we just made a REFERENCE to the original one.

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Use 'Object.assign()'.
    // The way that it works is that you start with a blank object: {}
    // Then you pass it the object you wish to copy all of the properties from ('person').
    // And then, you sort of fold in your new properties that you wish to overwrite: 'number: 99'.

    // And then you put all of this into its own variable:
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    // And now when you log 'cap2',...
    console.log(cap2);
    // ...you'll see we get 99:
    // { name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 99 };

    // However, if we go back to 'person', we'll see that 'number' has not been added:
    // { name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80 };

    // Same goes if we wanted to have a number of 99 and age 12:
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    // The captain is now 12:
    // { name: 'Wes Bos', age: 12, number: 99 };
    // But the person is 80:
    // { name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80 };

    // So what happened here is we take a blank object.
    // We overwrite, fold in, all of the properties and values from our object.
    // And then we use the third argument to fold in our own ones.


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread (an OBJECT SPREAD) (OBJECT SPREAD is not in JavaScript yet).
    // And this works exactly the same way as when we spread into an array,
    // but you can SPREAD into an object:
    const cap3 = { ...person };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep (this is very shallow) - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // It will only ever go 1 level deep.
    // Lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // So if we create a new object here:

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    console.log(wes);

    // And now if we want to make a COPY of 'wes', we would do:
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // And if we check 'dev', we get: { name: 'Wes', age: 100, social: { twitter: '@wesbos', facebook: 'wesbos.developer' }}

    // And if we do:
    dev.name = 'Wesley';

    // The 'wes' object still has 'Wes':
    // { name: 'Wes', age: 100, social: { twitter: '@wesbos', facebook: 'wesbos.developer' }}

    // And 'dev' is 'Wesley':
    // { name: 'Wesley', age: 100, social: { twitter: '@wesbos', facebook: 'wesbos.developer' }}

    // So you can see how we took a COPY of that object.
    // And when we update it, it's NOT going to update the original one, so it's NOT a reference.

    // HOWEVER, if we do this:
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    // and we check 'dev.social',
    // we get 'twitter: "@coolman"'.

    // But if we look at 'wes.social',
    // NOW we also get 'twitter: "@coolman"'!!!
    // WHY???

    // 'cloneDeep' Method'
    // The reason is, when you use 'Object.assign()',
    // it only does ONE LEVEL DEEP.
    // If you need to do a clone, you have to use a function called 'cloneDeep' (you can find it online),
    // and this will clone EVERY LEVEL as deep as you want.
    // Although before doing so, ask yourself if you really actually need to do that?
    // Maybe you could be doing it in a better spot,
    // because very rarely do you actually need to clone an object that deep.


    // THE POOR MAN'S 'deepClone'.
    // Another sort of cheating way (the poor man's 'deepClone') of doing this, though not receommended,
    // is by using 'JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))', and then you pass in your person ('wes').
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

    // Now we have 'dev2'. And now we do 'dev2.social.twitter' = '@coolman';

    // And now, when we look at 'wes.social', it has NOT been touched:
    // { twitter: '@wesbos', facebook: 'wesbos.developer' }}

    // Why?
    // Because what you can do is you can take 'JSON.stringify' and pass it an object:
    // JSON.stringify(wes)
    // And that will return to a STRING - it's no longer an object.
    // And then you immediately 'JSON.parse' it to turn it BACK into an object,
    // and then you get a FULL COPY of it, and you shake all the references.
