   The following is a common layout you would see in an email client.

   When a user clicks a checkbox, holds Shift, and then clicks another checkbox a few rows down, all the checkboxes inbetween those two checkboxes should be checked.

    // Select every single check box - we need to listen for when they get checked.
    const checkboxes = document.querySelectorAll('.inbox input[type="checkbox"]');
    // console.log(checkboxes);

    // When we click the first checkbox, we need to put that into a variable,
    // because when we click the second one (no matter which one), and you're holding down the 'shift' key,
    // we need to know what that last one was (i.e. the first button that was clicked).
    // So we'll create a variable called 'lastChecked' for this.
    // And we're using 'let' (not 'const'), because it's going to be reassigned constantly.
    // And then inside the 'handleCheck' function (the LAST thing we're going to do), we'll do 'lastChecked = this' (see below).
    let lastChecked;

    function handleCheck(e) {
      // console.log(e);
      // Check if they had the shift key down.

      // The other thing we need to do is when we uncheck, it will also trigger the 'handleCheck' function.
      // AND check that they are checking it.

      // Loop through every single checkbox, and look for the FIRST ONE that was checked, and then the LAST ONE.
      // As it loops through each box, it will say, "No, you're not check, no, no...yes, you are checked".
      // Then continue checking the next boxes until getting to the last box that was checked, and then STOP.
      // Rather than try to figure out where they are in the DOM, figuring out which elements are in between, finding parents, etc.
      // That's too fragile a way to do it - you're depending on having the HTML set just so.
      // And then in someone else comes along and changes the HTML a little, it would just break.

      // So, we're going to loop through every single checkbox.
      // We're going to create a variable called 'inBetween'.
      // And what 'inBetween' will do, is loop through and say 'inBetween = false' if it's not checked.
      // And when it finds the first checked box it will say, "Ok, this is where we started - we are now in the area which we wish to check".
      // Then keep checking.
      // The 'inBetween variable is going to be set' to 'true' when we're here (in between the first and last checked boxes).
      // And then when we hit our last checked box, we're going to say 'inBetween' is false,
      // because we're done, and we're no longer going to check any of the other boxes.
      let inBetween = false;

      // If the event of the shift key is there (that means the user is holding it down), AND 'this.checked'.
      // So, if the shift key is down AND they are checking the box, then we can continue with the code.
      if (e.shiftKey && this.checked) {
        // CONTINUE WITH CODE
        // Loop over every single checkbox
        checkboxes.forEach(checkbox => {
          console.log(checkbox);
          // As we loop, set the 'inBetween' variable to 'true'.
          if (checkbox === this || checkbox === lastChecked) {
            inBetween = !inBetween;
            console.log('Starting to check them in between.');
          }

          if (inBetween) {
            checkbox.checked = true;
          }
        });



      }
      // The other thing we need to do is when we uncheck, it will also trigger the 'handleCheck' function.





      lastChecked = this
    }

    // Listen for one of the checkboxes to get clicked or changed.
    // Loop over each one of the checkboxes and listen for a click (note that the 'click' event will fire,
    // even if you use your keyboard).
    // And so when someone clicks a checkbox, we're going to run a function called 'handleCheck' (see above).
    checkboxes.forEach(checkbox => checkbox.addEventListener('click', handleCheck));
