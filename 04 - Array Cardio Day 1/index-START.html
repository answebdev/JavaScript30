    // Some data we can work with

    const inventors = [
      { first: 'Albert', last: 'Einstein', year: 1879, passed: 1955 },
      { first: 'Isaac', last: 'Newton', year: 1643, passed: 1727 },
      { first: 'Galileo', last: 'Galilei', year: 1564, passed: 1642 },
      { first: 'Marie', last: 'Curie', year: 1867, passed: 1934 },
      { first: 'Johannes', last: 'Kepler', year: 1571, passed: 1630 },
      { first: 'Nicolaus', last: 'Copernicus', year: 1473, passed: 1543 },

      { first: 'Katherine', last: 'Blodgett', year: 1898, passed: 1979 },
      { first: 'Ada', last: 'Lovelace', year: 1815, passed: 1852 },
      { first: 'Sarah E.', last: 'Goode', year: 1855, passed: 1905 },
      { first: 'Lise', last: 'Meitner', year: 1878, passed: 1968 },
      { first: 'Hanna', last: 'Hammarström', year: 1829, passed: 1909 }
    ];

    const people = ['Beck, Glenn', 'Becker, Carl', 'Beckett, Samuel', 'Beddoes, Mick', 'Beecher, Henry', 'Beethoven, Ludwig', 'Begin, Menachem', 'Belloc, Hilaire', 'Bellow, Saul', 'Benchley, Robert', 'Benenson, Peter', 'Ben-Gurion, David', 'Benjamin, Walter', 'Benn, Tony', 'Bennington, Chester', 'Benson, Leana', 'Bent, Silas', 'Bentsen, Lloyd', 'Berger, Ric', 'Bergman, Ingmar', 'Berio, Luciano', 'Berle, Milton', 'Berlin, Irving', 'Berne, Eric', 'Bernhard, Sandra', 'Berra, Yogi', 'Berry, Halle', 'Berry, Wendell', 'Bethea, Erin', 'Bevan, Aneurin', 'Bevel, Ken', 'Biden, Joseph', 'Bierce, Ambrose', 'Biko, Steve', 'Billings, Josh', 'Biondo, Frank', 'Birrell, Augustine', 'Black, Elk', 'Blair, Robert', 'Blair, Tony', 'Blake, William'];

    // Array.prototype.filter()
    // 1. Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's.

    // Use 'filter'. The way 'filter' works is you pass in a function, and that function is going to loop through every single item in our 'inventors' array,
    // and it's going to give us the inventor.
    // So, we take the inventors and loop over them, and for each inventor, we can decide whether we want to keep it or not --> use if statement.
    // So by returning 'true', that means we keep it.
    // And you do not have to do 'else' 'return false'.
    const fifteen = inventors.filter(function (inventor) {
      if (inventor.year >= 1500 && inventor.year < 1600) {
        return true; // Keep it
      }
    })
    console.log(fifteen);

    // Looks nicer in the console:
    console.table(fifteen);

    // This solution can be greatly reduced (both solutions work):
    // const fifteen = inventors.filter(inventor => inventor.year >= 1500 && inventor.year < 1600)


    // Array.prototype.map()
    // 2. Give us an array of the inventors first and last names
    // 'map' takes in an array, it does something with that array, and then returns a NEW array, but of the SAME LENGTH.
    // 'map' is like a factory machine, where it takes in raw material, and will stamp it somehow, and then pick out that item on the other end.
    // Whereas 'filter' you can take in 10 things and return 2, 'map' will always return THE SAME AMOUNT OF ITEMS as you give it.
    const fullNames = inventors.map(inventor => `${inventor.first} ${inventor.last}`);
    console.log(fullNames);

    // Array.prototype.sort()
    // 3. Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest
    // The way that 'sort' works is that you get two items, and you sort just those two items.
    // And the way that you do that is be returning 1 and -1, and that's going to bubble these items up and down in the array.
    const ordered = inventors.sort(function (firstPerson, secondPerson) {
      if (firstPerson.year > secondPerson.year) {
        return 1;
      } else {
        return -1;
      }
    });

    console.table(ordered);

    // This can be reduced by using a TERNARY OPERATOR (a shorthand if statement).
    // const ordered = inventors.sort((firstPerson, secondPerson) => firstPerson.year > secondPerson.year ? 1 : -1);
    // console.table(ordered);

    // Array.prototype.reduce()
    // 4. How many years did all the inventors live all together?
    // What 'reduce' does is give you what you've returned from this function the last time ('total'), and is also going to give you the 'inventor'.
    // And from that, it's going to return the 'total', which is what the total was last time around (again, 'reduce', 'sort', 'filter' just loop over every single one).
    // And then we're going to return the number of years that that inventor lived.

    const totalYears = inventors.reduce((total, inventor) => {
      return total + (inventor.passed - inventor.year);
    }, 0);
    // We need '0' here, because the first time it loops, there is not 'total', so it's 'undefined'.
    console.log(totalYears);

    // 5. Sort the inventors by years lived
    // 'a' means first person; 'b' means second person.
    const oldest = inventors.sort(function (a, b) {
      const lastGuy = a.passed - a.year;
      const nextGuy = b.passed - b.year;
      if (lastGuy > nextGuy) {
        return -1;
      } else {
        return 1;
      }
    });
    console.table(oldest);

    // 6. create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Boulevards_in_Paris

    // We need to first get the DOM elements out of the page:
    // We could do 'document.querySelector' but we don't know what to select.
    // So, we have to use our dev tools and inspect the Wikipedia page (see link above),
    // to see what element contains this, which is 'mw-category'.
    const category = document.querySelector('.mw-category');

    // Then we want to find the links within it ('querySelector('a')').
    // Note: you can call 'querySelector' on any existing DOM element (e.g. 'category') -
    // it doesn't always have to be 'document'. It could look inside of an existing element.

    // const links = category.querySelector('a');
    // const links = Array.from(category.querySelector('a'));
    // const links = [...category.querySelector('a')];

    // First we're going to convert the list of links into a list of names.
    // Then we're going to filter that list of names to only include 'de' anywhere in the name.
    // Remember that 'querySelector' returns a Node List, so we cannot use 'map' (which is only for arrays).
    // So we first need to change the previous line into an array, because now it's just a Node List.
    // So we can do that by using the 'spread' operator to SPREAD every single item into an array (see previous code above)
    // (you could also use 'Array.from').
    // The SPREAD operator will take every item OUT OF something (an iterable, which in this case is a Node List),
    // and put it into the containing array.


    // 7. sort Exercise
    // Sort the people alphabetically by last name
    const alpha = people.sort(function (lastOne, nextOne) {

      // This gives us an array where the first element is thelast name,
      // and the second element is the first name, which is backwards:

      // const parts = lastOne.split(', ');

      // So, what we can do is destructure that, meaning that, rather than return an array,
      // we can t those into their own variables right away:
      const [aLast, aFirst] = lastOne.split(', ');
      // Now we can log them as their own separate variables:
      // console.log(aLast, aFirst);

      const [bLast, bFirst] = nextOne.split(', ');

      return aLast > bLast ? 1 : -1;
    });
    console.log(alpha);

    // 8. Reduce Exercise
    // Use 'reduce'
    // 'reduce' is one of the most flexible methods that we have in an array,
    // and this is just another way that we can use it:

    // Sum up the instances of each of these
    const data = ['car', 'car', 'truck', 'truck', 'bike', 'walk', 'car', 'van', 'bike', 'walk', 'car', 'van', 'car', 'truck'];

    const transportation = data.reduce(function (obj, item) {
      // console.log(item);
      if (!obj[item]) {
        obj[item] = 0;
      }
      obj[item]++;
      return obj;
      // Put an empty object ({}), so we can loop over every single one.
    }, {});

    console.log(transportation);
