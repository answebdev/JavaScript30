  <!-- We just have this canvas element that we need to draw on: -->

    // HSL SECTION
    // See: https://mothereffinghsl.com/

    // HSL is essentially the rainbow, but you can programmatically select pieces of the rainbow.
    // So, the HUE (H) part of HSL is from red all the way over to red on a rainbow.
    // The SATURATION (S) is how bright it is.
    // The L is the lightness. Lightness all the way is white, and the absence of lightness is black.
    // HSL = Hue Saturation Lightness.

    // So what we can do using https://mothereffinghsl.com/ is to programmatically pick different pieces of the rainbow.
    // So if 0 is red, and 360 is the other spectrum, that means that for every 360 draws that we do,
    // we can just pick an increment of color, and then flip it back.

    // So down in our initial variables (see down below), we can do:
    // let hue = 0;
    // And as we draw, before we begin the path, we'll say:
    // ctx.strokeStyle (remember, we started with '#BADA55', but now we're going to be setting it with the variable 'hue',
    // and then we're going to give it 100% saturation and 50% lightness: `hsl(${hue}, 100%, 50%)`):
    // ctx.strokeStyle = `hsl(${hue}, 100%, 50%)`;


    // First, we need to grab the canvas element.
    const canvas = document.querySelector('#draw');

    // The second thing we need is something called a 'context'.
    // Canvas on the web is sort of like Microsoft Paint, where you just get a block of actual pixels,
    // and you need to then draw on that.
    // You don't draw directly on the canvas element in HTML. You draw on something called the 'context'.
    // And the 'context' can either be 2D (which is what we'll be working with here), or 3D.

    // So, the second thing we need to do is grab the 'context', and ask it for the '2d' context:
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    // The next thing we need to do is to size up our canvas to be the exact width of the window .
    // By default, the canvas is going to be 800 pixels by 800 pixels (width="800" height="800" - see HTML above).
    // However, we want to resize it before we do any of our drawing.
    // This will make the canvas as big as the window is:
    canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
    canvas.height = window.innerHeight;

    // Set the base settings: strokeStyle, lineCap, lineJoin.
    // When you draw on something, there needs to be a color, and we're going to start with '#BADA55'.
    // Also, the end of the line, should it be squared off? And when a line meets another line, or rounded around the corners. So that's what 'lineJoin' and 'lineCap' are about.
    ctx.strokeStyle = '#BADA55';
    ctx.lineJoin = 'round';
    ctx.lineCap = 'round';

    // By default the lines drawn are really thin, so let's set the width:
    ctx.lineWidth = 100;

    // We can also play with the Global Composite Operator, which are like PhotoShop blend modes,
    // and which can be used inside of 'context'.
    // And what happens here, is when we draw on the canvas, the colors will blend with each other as you draw over them.
    // So we can also play with the different blend modes, like 'multiply', 'subtract':
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation
    ctx.globalCompositeOperation = 'multiply';

    // Next, we need a couple dummy variables.
    // What this does, is when we click down on the canvas element, and we move our mouse, and then we let go, and then we mov our mouse again,
    // nothing happens when we're moving our mouse.
    // It only draws when our cursor is actually down.

    // So, what we're doing is creating like a flag here ('isDrawing'), where we set it to 'false',
    // and then when we click down, we set it to 'true'.
    // And when we click up (we let go of the button), we're going to set it to 'false'.
    // And so this is sort of going to be our flag to tell us, should we actually draw to this canvas,
    // or is someone just moving their mouse without doing anything?
    let isDrawing = false;

    // 'lastX' and 'lastY' are going to help us out, because when we draw to a canvas, what needs to happen for us to draw a line is
    // we need a starting x and y, and an ending x and y.
    // You can't just tell it to draw a line at coordinates 100 and 100 (for example), because a line needs a start and a stop, not just a start.
    // So 'lastX' and 'lastY' is going to be where we start the line from, and then when we finish drawing, where we end.
    let lastX = 0;
    let lastY = 0;

    // Set 'hue' to 0 (see HSL SECTION above)
    let hue = 0;

    // This means that it's going to be building up.
    let direction = true;

    // Next, we need a function ('draw'), and it's going to take in an event ('e').
    // This 'draw' function is going to be called whenever we move our mouse on top of the canvas.
    // But we don't want this to run all the time, we want to only do it when the user has clicked down.
    // So we'll add an if statement: if the user is not drawing ('!isDrawing'), then 'return'.
    // And this will stop the function from running when a user is not moused down.
    // So everything below this if statement is only going to run when the user's mouse is actually down.
    // So that's our click and drag functionality done.

    // And then we'll have another event listener down below to change this '!isDrawing' --> 'mousedown'.
    function draw(e) {
      if (!isDrawing) return;
      console.log(e);

      // See HSL SECTION above:
      // And as we draw, before we begin the path, we'll say:
      // ctx.strokeStyle (remember, we started with '#BADA55', but now we're going to be setting it with the variable 'hue',
      // and then we're going to give it 100% saturation and 50% lightness: `hsl(${hue}, 100%, 50%)`):
      // ctx.strokeStyle = `hsl(${hue}, 100%, 50%)`;
      ctx.strokeStyle = `hsl(${hue}, 100%, 50%)`;

      // What we can also do, is we can also change the line width.
      // Remember, we set the width above (to change the default width), so we can use that variable as well.
      // And we can set it to 'hue'.
      // And what will happen is, as we draw, the width will get bigger and bigger (just as the hue continues to increment up to 360 -
      // we've incremented hue below: 'hue++').
      // And then at some point, when 'hue' gets to 360 and resets to 0,
      // the line width will start over again and be thin again.

      // ctx.lineWidth = hue;

      // But as it is, the line width gets too fat as we keep drawing.
      // So we'll declare a variable 'direction' and set it to 'true' (see above).
      // This means that it's going to be building up.
      // So we have 'let direction = true'.
      // And we dont' want 'ctx.lineWidth = hue', so we'll get rid of that.

      // And then down below where we increment 'hue' ('hue++'),
      // for every loop, we are going to increment the line width (see below).

      // Code the logic for the actual drawing.
      // All of these following 'ctx' lines start up our line, but we're not actually going to see anything on the page
      // until we call 'stroke()' (down at the end of these lines).

      // The first thing we want to do is start a 'path' (remember, 'ctx' is where we do all of our drawing for our canvas).
      ctx.beginPath();

      // Start from.
      // Then, we need to start with an x and a y, move it to an x and a y, and that will complete our drawing of that.
      ctx.moveTo(lastX, lastY);

      // Go to.
      // 'e.offsetX' and 'e.offsetY' are values that come from the actual event that happens.
      ctx.lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY);

      // Finally, we call 'ctx.stroke()'':
      ctx.stroke();

      // When we're done, this 'draw' function, we want to update 'lastX' and 'lastY' to be wherever they were on the canvas.
      // lastX = e.offsetX;
      // lastY = e.offsetY;
      // -->
      // ES6 Trick (Destructuring an Array): We can actually set both of these variables in one line:
      [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];

      // Increment the 'hue' setting so that the hue changes as we draw.
      // Remember initially, 'hue' is set to 0 (see above). So, the second time we draw, it'll be 1. The third time, 2, etc.
      hue++;

      // And eventually, as we keep drawing, we're just going to get all the way around.
      // And the cool part about HSL, is if we go over 360, it'll be, for example, 906, but it'll just keep going around and around.
      // So what we could also do is to reset the hue if it's greater than or equal to 360. And this will work just as well.
      if (hue >= 360) {
        hue = 0;
      }

      // For every loop, we are going to increment the line width: 'ctx.lineWidth++'.
      // And what this will do is increment the line width.
      // But it will just keep getting infinitely bigger, so we'll add an if statement.
      // So if the line width is >= 100 OR <= 1, then we want to flip the 'direction' (which we declared up above).
      if (ctx.lineWidth >= 100 || ctx.lineWidth <= 1) {
        direction = !direction;
      }
      // If 'direction' is equal to 'true', then the line width goes up.
      // otherwise, the line width goes down.
      if (direction) {
        ctx.lineWidth++;
      } else {
        ctx.lineWidth--;
      }
    }

    // Event listener for when the mouse is down.
    // When the mouse is down, we'll say, 'isDrawing = true'.
    canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
      isDrawing = true;

      // Update our 'lastX' and 'lastY'.
      // So as soon as a user clicks down on the mouse to start, before doing a 'mousemove' (because 'mousedown' will happen before the mouse is moved),
      // then we're going to update 'lastX' and 'lastY'.
      // And this is going to put us where we want to go, rather than starting at 0 and 0.
      [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];
    });

    // Listen for the 'mousemove' event on the canvas. Notice that the 'mousemove' event calls the 'draw' function.
    // So now when we move our mouse on the canvas ('mousemove'), it's going to call the 'draw' function.
    canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', draw);

    // When the mouse is up, 'isDrawing = false'.
    canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', () => isDrawing = false);

    // Listen for 'mouseout' --> 'isDrawing = false'.
    // What can happen is you can click down, let your mouse leave the actual window and let go, and come back.
    // And it's still going to think the mouse is down.
    // That's what 'mouseout' is, and why we set 'isDrawing' to 'false',
    // so that when you 'mouseout', it's going to automatically say, "Oh, you're no longer drawing".
    canvas.addEventListener('mouseout', () => isDrawing = false);
