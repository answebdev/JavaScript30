    // We're going to create a new speech synthesis utterance, meaningm what is the person going to say.
    // And on that utterance, it's going to contain some information about how fast they say it,
    // the pitch of their voice, the voice they say it in, and what they will be saying.
    // So all of that is going to be put into our utterance.
    // So we're creating a new version of that into the variable 'msg'.
    const msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();
    // Empty array where voices are going to be dumped into.
    let voices = [];
    const voicesDropdown = document.querySelector('[name="voice"]');
    const options = document.querySelectorAll('[type="range"], [name="text"]');
    const speakButton = document.querySelector('#speak');
    const stopButton = document.querySelector('#stop');

    // What we need to do is on page load, whatever is in the text area, we want to set that to be the default.
    // And we want to select the text box and set it to be whatever is in there.
    // And we'll pull the 'value' right out of there.
    msg.text = document.querySelector('[name="text"]').value;
    // Now if we go to the dev tools and type 'msg' in the console,
    // we can see that we have our 'SpeechSynthesisUtterance', and the text is now equal to "Hello! I love JavaScript üëç"
    // (although there is no voice being set yet).

    // Populate all the different voices.
    // If a 'SpeechSynthesisUtterance' is a thing that a person might say, we also have another global variable called 'speechSynthesis'.
    // And what 'speechSynthesis' will do is, you can call '.speak' on it ('speechSynthesis.speak()'), and pass it an utterance, which is going to be our 'msg'.
    // And we can take that global variable ('speechSynthesis') and add an event listener to it.
    // And there's an event called 'voiceschanged'.
    // And when that happens, we're going to populate our voices.

    // So we're going to make a function called 'populateVoices'.
    // Then we will take that 'voices' array that we declared above and override it with 'this.getVoices()'.
    // And this can't just be called on page load, because when 'speechSynthesis' loads, it has to fire the 'voiceschanged' event.
    // Sometimes it takes a second in order for it to load, so we need to wait until we run the 'voiceschanged'.
    function populateVoices() {
      voices = this.getVoices();
      // And now when we log this, we should see all the different built in voices in the console (Macs have more voices built in).
      console.log(voices);

      // Each of these voices have a name and a language code that they speak in.
      // So we need to loop over all of these speech voices and set them as options in our dropdown.
      // And then we 'filter' to get only English voices ('filter' before mapping), if you want.
      voicesDropdown.innerHTML = voices
        // .filter(voice => voice.lang.includes('en'))
        .map(voice => `<option value="${voice.name}">${voice.name} (${voice.lang})</option>`)
        .join('');

      // Now that the voices are actually loaded on the page, we can take a look at our message in the console (type 'msg' in the console and open it up).
      // There still is no voice on it (when we open it up, we see 'voice: null'), but because those voices have been loaded into the page,
      // it will default to out default voice.

      // So we can now call 'speechSynthesis.speak(msg)' in the console, and we'll be able to hear the voice reading the sentence, "Hello! I love JavaScript üëç".

      // So we've got an utterance. And we've got a 'speechSyntehsis' that will then take that utterance and speak it.
      // But, we want to be able to choose one of the voices from the dropdown.
    }

    // This function is going to be called when we change from the dropdown.
    // This changes the voice in the dropdown in the UI.
    // So we have our utterance ('msg'), and we want to set the voice on it.
    // So what we need to do is find the voice that lines up with the value.
    // And the way we can do that is to do: 'console.log(this.value)', and we should get the name in the console.
    function setVoice() {
      console.log(this.value);
      toggle();

      // But we need to find, not just the name of it.
      // And if we look at our voices array in the console (type 'voices'), we need to find the corresponding 'SpeechSynthesisVoice' object.
      // And the way we do that is by doing -> msg.voice = voices.find(voice => voice.name === this.value);
      // Essentialy what this is doing, is it's going to loop over every single one of these voices in the array,
      // and it's going to find the one where its name attribute is the same as the option that was currently selected.
      // And then we set it.

      // And now when we select a voice from the dropdown and type 'speechSynthesis.speak(msg)' in the console,
      // we will hear the sentence spoken in the voice that we chose.
      msg.voice = voices.find(voice => voice.name === this.value);
    }

    // Make a function so that everytime we select a voice from the dropdown,
    // we want to restart it.
    // So everytime you change voices, the current voice will stop speaking the current sentence
    // and start speaking in the new voice selected.
    // And we pass in the flag 'startOver = true', because sometimes you might want to pass 'false',
    // so that it will NOT restart itself. And then take care of this in an if statement.
    function toggle(startOver = true) {
      // Cancel anything we have that is currently speaking.
      // 'cancel()' will stop it from speaking.
      speechSynthesis.cancel();

      // By default, it's 'true' so you don't have to pass in anything.
      if (startOver) {
        // Restart the entire thing.
        speechSynthesis.speak(msg);
      }
    }

    function setOption() {
      // When we check the console and move the Rate and Pitch sliders, we see the changes in the console.
      // And if we change the text in the text box and click away, we see the updated text in the console.
      console.log(this.name, this.value);

      // So now we've found all of our options.
      // When they change, we know what property will change (this.name) and what it was changed to (this.value).
      // So we simply need to take our message and set what property changed (this.name) to what changed (this.value).
      msg[this.name] = this.value;

      // Then we can stop it and start it over.
      toggle();
    }

    // and when that happens, it's going to run a function called 'setOptions'.

    // Listen for a 'click' on the Speak button. This will run 'toggle()', which is going to manually run it.
