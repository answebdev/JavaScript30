  <!-- Working with mousemove events and HTML5 video.

  Experimenting with an input that controls how fast a video plays, so that rather than having to click up and down to change the video speed,
  you can change it with the input as you're watching the video, that that it goes slower and faster.
  The lowest is going to be 0.4x, and the highest is going to be 4x. -->

      // Doing 'console.log(y)' below, now when we hover over at the very top, we get 0 for Y, and around 410 at the very bottom.

      // To do this, we calculate what the playback rate is (remember that our min speed is 0.4, and the max is 4 - it's not min 0 and max 1;
      // so we need to do some math here).
