    // Listen for a mousemove event on our hero
    const hero = document.querySelector('.hero');
    // Text inside hero
    const text = hero.querySelector('h1');

    const walk = 150; // 100px - this will be used in our math equation (see below)

    function shadow(e) {
      // Anytime we mouseover, we will get all this information in the console
      // console.log(e);

      // Get the width and height of the hero
      // regular way:
      // const width = hero.offsetWidth;
      // const height = hero.offsetHeight;

      // Destructuring:
      const { offsetWidth: width, offsetHeight: height } = hero;

      // Get information about where cursor was.
      // Destructuring:
      let { offsetX: x, offsetY: y } = e;

      // When you check in the console, you'll get the x and y as you move the mouse around
      console.log(x, y);
      // But if you hover right in the top corner of the h1 tag, the numbers are close to 0, which is weird.
      // And what's happening is that the event, even though we're listening for the mousemove on the hero,
      // if there are children elements inside of the hero, it's going to give us the x and the y of the actual element that we hover over, which is kind of a pain.

      // So we need to do a little bit of normalization here to say, "Okay, if the thing that we're actually hovering over is the h1, instead of the hero,
      // then modify the x and the y values, so that they're going to be consistent across all of them."
      // So we'll use an if statement for this ('this' is a div with the class of 'hero').
      // And the 'target' is the thing that it actually triggered on, whereas 'this' is going to be the thing that you listen on.
      // So it's always going to be 'hero' for this. But the 'target' (what it got triggered on), will sometimes change.

      // So if these two things are NOT the same ('this' and 'e.target'), then:
      // x = x + e.target.offsetLeft;
      // y = y + e.target.offsetTop;

      // So basically, if someone hovers in the top left hand corner of the h1,
      // we're just going to add the like 2 pixels that it's given us, plus whatever it is from the left, and whatever it is from the top.

      // console.log(this, e.target);
      if (this !== e.target) {
        x = x + e.target.offsetLeft;
        y = y + e.target.offsetTop;
      }

      // Now when we hover over the h1, the values are not weird and back to 0, so our if statement fixed that issue.
      // console.log(x, y);

      // Now we need to figure out how far the text shadow should actually go.
      // We need something I like to call a 'walk'.
      // So if the cursor is all the way to the top left, how much over and back should it go?
      // If it's all the way over, how much over should it go? How much all the way down should it go?
      // I like to call that the 'walk'.
      // So, how many pixels at its most should it be stretched?
      // So let's declare a variable called 'walk' and make it 100 pixels (see above).

      // Here is where it gets a little bit tricky.
      // If the cursor was all the way over in the bottom right corner, it's not going to be 200 px; it's going to be +100.
      // And when it's all the way in the top left, it's not going to be 0; it's going to be negative.

      // So what this equation is: if 100 is the highest it will go, 0 is not the lowest we'll go.
      // If 100 is our 'walk' (see above where 'walk' is declared), then 50 should be as high as we go,
      // and -50 should be as low as we go.
      // So our 'walk' is 100, so we want to go from 50 to -50.
      // And that's what these equations are doing, sort of offsetting it, so we go to 50 and -50 instead of 0, 100:
      const xWalk = Math.round((x / width * walk) - (walk / 2));
      const yWalk = Math.round((y / height * walk) - (walk / 2));

      // Now when we move the mouse around and check the console, we get a bunch of pixel values.
      // And the numbers are a little bit long (e.g. 5.781250000000007),
      // so we could do a 'Math.round' around them (see equations above).
      // And now if we go to the top left, we get -50 -50.
      // And if you go to the bottom right, we get 50 50.
      // Great.
      console.log(xWalk, yWalk);

      // So now, all that's left for us is we take our text, and we can use the 'style' attribute, and set the text shadow.
      // It looks like this, but we're going to use 'xWalk' and 'yWalk'.
      // And when we check the dev tools (Elements tab), we can see the values are updated as we move around.
      // text.style.textShadow = `10px 10px 0 red`;
      // text.style.textShadow = `${xWalk}px ${yWalk}px 0 red`;

      // And we could also do multiple colors by just adding a comma after each 'textShadow' style and adding another,
      // and have them go in different directions as well (note: xWalk * -1, etc.):
      text.style.textShadow = `
      ${xWalk}px ${yWalk}px 0 rgba(255,0,255,0.7),
      ${xWalk * -1}px ${yWalk}px 0 rgba(0,255,255,0.7),
      ${yWalk}px ${xWalk * -1}px 0 rgba(0,255,0,0.7),
      ${yWalk * -1}px ${xWalk}px 0 rgba(0,0,255,0.7)
    `;

    }
    // When the mouse moves, we're going to run the function 'shadow'
    hero.addEventListener('mousemove', shadow);
