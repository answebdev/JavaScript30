    const endpoint = 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29/raw/2bf258763cdddd704f8ffd3ea9a3e81d25e2c6f6/cities.json';

    // We need to first fetch the data (which is a huge array).
    // Then, once that data is back, whenever a user types in to the input field,
    // we're going to filter that array down to a subset of all of the ones
    // of either the city name, or the state name will match.

    // To do that, we first need an empty array to put our cities into.
    const cities = [];

    // Then we need to fetch our data. We're going to be using a new API in the browser called FETCH.
    // And we FETCH the endpoint.
    // And what FETCH will do is return a promise, which means something like, something will eventually come back from this FETCH.

    // So the way that we can work with a promise is to call '.then' against it.
    // And this is going to return a bunch of data.
    // And what happens is that the data that comes back from our FETCH - it doesn't know what kind of data it is yet (it could be an image, some HTML, audio, etc.).
    // We know that it is JSON, but we can't just do something like 'JSON.parse(result)'.
    // And this is because the 'result' (or 'blob', or whatever you want to call it) has to be CONVERTED from the raw data that it is in, into JSON.
    // To do this, we use the 'json()' method --> 'blob.json' (or 'result.json', etc.) --> and doing this will itself return ANOTHER PROMISE,
    // which we're going to call '.then' on. And that is going to give us the raw data --> '.then(data => console.log(data))'.

    // So now that we get the data in the console, how do we get this data into 'cities', our empty array?
    // If we try to PUSH the items into 'cities', we will get nested arrays, which is not what we want.

    // So how do we get each and every item to go into 'cities'?
    // So if we, for example, push something like 1,2,3,4 --> 'cities.push(1,2,3,4)', and then look at 'cities',
    // You'll see that everytime we have an argument to push, it will put it as its own item in the array.
    // And the way that we can change this array into individual arguments, is we SPREAD into it.
    // So we simply SPREAD into this PUSH method, and now we get what we want - an array of cities:
    // --> 'cities.push(...data)'.
    fetch(endpoint)
      .then(blob => blob.json())
      .then(data => cities.push(...data))

    // The next thing we need to do is, when someone types into the input field,
    // we need to run a function that is going to take our massive array, and FILTER it down into a subset,
    // where you can then listen for it.

    // So were going to create a function called 'findMatches', and that's going to take in a 'wordToMatch' and the 'cities' array,
    // because we want to pass in the data into the function that it's going to filter.

    // And from that, we're going to 'return' the 'cities' array,
    // but we're going to call FILTER on it, which is going to chisel it down into a subset of that initial array.
    // So, each one is going to have a 'place', which is each individual city and state and population.
    // And from that, we need to figure out if the city or state matches what was searched.
    // We want to be able to do it, so that if someone types in 'Bos', it returns 'Boston' and any other places with 'Bos'.

    // So we need a couple of RegExps (Regular Expressions).
    // So how do we put a variable ('wordToMatch') into a Regular Expression?
    // We need to create a Regular Expression: 'const regex = new RegExp(wordToMatch, 'gi')'
    // In our Regular Expression, 'g' means 'global' (i.e. it's going to look through the entire string).
    // 'i' means insensitive, meaning it's going to match lowercase as well as uppercase, regardless of what you use to search.

    // So now we call '.match()' with our 'regex' in here, and that's going to take the 'place.city'.
    // And also need to match the state, so: '|| place.state.match(regex)'.
    // And this will check if the city OR the state has either one (e.g. 'Bos').
    // So if one or the other is true, the whole thing is going to be true,
    // and so our filter is going to be much smaller, and it will return a smaller array of our filtered items.
    // And we now have our 'findMatches' function done.

    function findMatches(wordToMatch, cities) {
      return cities.filter(place => {

        // Figure out if the city or state matches what was searched
        const regex = new RegExp(wordToMatch, 'gi');
        return place.city.match(regex) || place.state.match(regex)
      });
    }

    // Function that adds in commas to the population:
    function numberWithCommas(x) {
      return x.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',');
    }

    // Now we need to create our display function.
    // And this is going to be called whenever someone changes the value in the input field.
    function displayMatches() {
      // console.log(this.value);

      // Use the 'findMatches' function we created.
      // So that whenever we type into the input field, it will run the 'displayMatches' function,
      // call our 'findMatches' function, and find ones that match what we typed in.
      const matchArray = findMatches(this.value, cities);
      // console.log(matchArray);

      // Loop over it.
      // This 'map' is going to return an array when we really want is just one string.
      // So at the end (see below), we can call '.join('')',
      // and this will turn it from an array with multiple items, into one big string.
      const html = matchArray.map(place => {
        // To highlight whatever we searched for in the results:
        // Create a RegEx to match the city name, then use that RegEx to replace the word that it matches,
        // with a span with a class of "hl", and the word that it matches.
        // So this is going to find whatever it matched in the RegEx, and replace it with a span with a class of highlight,
        // and then the value that the user had searched for.
        const regex = new RegExp(this.value, 'gi');
        const cityName = place.city.replace(regex, `<span class="hl">${this.value}</span>`);

        // And do the same for the state name:
        const stateName = place.state.replace(regex, `<span class="hl">${this.value}</span>`);
        return `
          <li>
            <span class="name">${cityName}, ${stateName}</span>
            <span class="population">${numberWithCommas(place.population)}</span>
          </li>
        `;
      }).join('');
      // Finally, once we've mapped over this array, we can call 'suggestions.innerHTML = html;'
      // And 'html' is what we declared up above ('const html = ...').
      suggestions.innerHTML = html;
    }

    const searchInput = document.querySelector('.search');
    const suggestions = document.querySelector('.suggestions');

    // Lisen for the 'change' event. Then when the input changes, call 'displayMatches'.
    // Note that the 'change' event only fires when the user goes off the input field, not when you type and do KEYUP.
    // If you also want it to fire on KEYUP, then we just add that line of code, so that it listens for the 'keyup' event,
    // and then run 'displayMatches' on that as well.
    searchInput.addEventListener('change', displayMatches);
    searchInput.addEventListener('keyup', displayMatches);
