  <!-- Making a photo booth with JavaScript

  Here, our video is being piped in from our webcam, and the we have our video piped into a canvas element.
  And once it's in a canvas element, we can then start to do all kinds of things with it,
  like take our photo and then download it.

  And in these scripts, once we add them, we can start to add effects, like different filters, RGB split, play with the alpha, green screen, etc. -->

  <div class="photobooth">
    <div class="controls">
      <button onClick="takePhoto()">Take Photo</button>

      <!-- Sliders to manipulate colors: -->
      <div class="rgb">
        <label for="rmin">Red Min:</label>
        <input type="range" min=0 max=255 name="rmin">
        <label for="rmax">Red Max:</label>
        <input type="range" min=0 max=255 name="rmax">

        <br>

        <label for="gmin">Green Min:</label>
        <input type="range" min=0 max=255 name="gmin">
        <label for="gmax">Green Max:</label>
        <input type="range" min=0 max=255 name="gmax">

        <br>

        <label for="bmin">Blue Min:</label>
        <input type="range" min=0 max=255 name="bmin">
        <label for="bmax">Blue Max:</label>
        <input type="range" min=0 max=255 name="bmax">
      </div>
    </div>


    <!-- The video from our webcam is going to come in, and we're going to pipe that into this <video> element below.
    And then (maybe every 16 ms or so), we're going to take a snapshot of that video,
    and dump it into the <canvas> element.
    Once it's in the <canvas>, we're going to manipulate the pixels, change the color of the filters, etc.

    So, the video is going to come off the webcam on the <video> element, and we're going to dump it into the <canvas> every so often.
    And then finally, we're going to put all of our images down in the <div> element with the class of "strip". -->

    <video class="player"></video>
    <div class="strip"></div>
  </div>

  <audio class="snap" src="./snap.mp3" hidden></audio>
