  <!-- How to do Click and Drag from scratch.
  When you click, drag your mouse, and go somewhere, you want the item you clicked on to come along with it. -->

  <script>
    // Select the "items" div; then we're going to be listening for a number of different events.
    // So, when we first click down, we're going to add a class of 'active',
    // and we're goingt to figure out WHERE we clicked down.
    // Then we we move our mouse either to the left or right, we need to figure out how many pixels we need to scroll in either direction.
    // So, depending on how far either way we scroll, that's how much we're going to be scrolling the div.
    // So it's just a combination of mousedown, mouseleave, mouseup, and mousemove.

    // Grab the slider:
    const slider = document.querySelector('.items');

    // Our flag variable that's going to be true or false depending on if we're clicking or not.
    let isDown = false;

    // No values assigned to these variables, because that's going to be happening in our events.
    let startX;
    let scrollLeft;

    // Attach the listeners (mousedown, mouseleave, mouseup, and mousemove).

    // When someone mouses down, take 'isDown' variable and set it to 'true'

    // When we click and drag, say 20px to the left/right, we need to know where that anchor point is when we scroll to the left or right,
    // because as many times as we move around, until we mouseup,
    // we need to know where that intial click down was.
    // And that's what the 'startX' variable is for (see above).
    // So when someone clicks down, before they start moving to the left or right,
    // we need to record where they did that intial click down.
    // And that's going to happen here in our 'mousedown'.
    slider.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
      isDown = true;
      slider.classList.add('active');

      // If we pass in the event and check the console, one way to tell where we clicked,
      // is to do: 'console.log(epageX)'.
      // And then it's going to tell us exactly where we clicked. It's going to give us the X coordinate: a number in the console.
      // console.log(e.pageX);

      // But if there were a margin in between the page and the item that we click on, then this number would be off.
      // So we'll need to do 'startX = e.pageX - slider.offsetLeft'.
      // And this will handle this offset for us:
      startX = e.pageX - slider.offsetLeft;
      // console.log(startX);

      // The other thing we need to log at the time of click is the scroll,
      // because let's say we scroll 200px in, and we want to scroll to the left or right of the div,
      // then we need to figure out where the intial scroll was when we stared it.
      // And that's what the 'scrollLeft' variable is for (see above).
      scrollLeft = slider.scrollLeft;
    });

    // When someone leaves the 'items' div, it shouldn't work, so set 'isDown' to 'false'.
    slider.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
      isDown = false;
      slider.classList.remove('active');
    });

    // When someone mouses up, set 'isDown' to 'false'.
    slider.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
      isDown = false;
      slider.classList.remove('active');
    });

    // All the magic happens here.
    slider.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
      // Stop the function from running if the mouse is not down.
      if (!isDown) return;
      // console.log(isDown);
      // console.count(isDown);
      // console.log("Do work!")
      // console.log(startX);

      // This will stop any selecting of text that's inside, or any other stuff that the browser thinks you're trying to select.
      e.preventDefault();

      // Figure out where the cursor is when it's moved.
      // We already know where the cursor is when a user initially clicks down.
      // But we want to know where the cursor is when someone moves it to the left or right.

      // We this line, we're going to recalculate every single time we move the mouse.
      const x = e.pageX - slider.offsetLeft;

      // TIP: Putting the variables in an object (using {}) will enable you to see the value.
      // So when we click and move around, we can see that the X value ('x') is changing,
      // and the 'startX' is not. changing at all.

      // So we can take that and call that the 'walk' -> '  const walk = x - startX'.
      // And this is going to tell us how far we deviated from that initial space.
      // console.log({ x, startX });

      const walk = (x - startX);

      // If it doesn't scroll enough to your liking when you click and drag, you can multiply this by a number (e.g.),
      // and then when you scroll, it will scroll more at once.
      // So for every pixel moved, the slider is going to scroll 3 pixels (or whatever number you multiply by):
      // const walk = (x - startX) * 3;

      // So what we will see is when we click and drag 20px to the right, we should see '20',
      // and then go back to our initial point, and then go 20px to the left, we should see '-20'.
      // So it's telling us how far we've deviated from our initial point.
      console.log(walk);

      // Change the div so that it actually scrolls - do that with the 'scrollLeft' property.
      // Now we should be able to click and drag back and forth.
      slider.scrollLeft = scrollLeft - walk;
    });
