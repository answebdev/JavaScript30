  <!-- Topic: Learning about key sequencing detection.
  This means, when someone inputs a certain sequence of keys, into the window, an input, etc.
  then something needs to happen.
  And what this is used most for online is the Konami Code (in video games in the 80's or 90s, if you did on your controller a sequence like
  up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A...then this will trigger unlimited lives, or something like that - cheat code).
  
  https://www.buzzfeed.com/ has a Konami Code. If you do "up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A(-Enter)" (using the arrow keys for the directions),
  then something happens (as of this date, confetti-like dots fall).
  Different websites have easter eggs like this.

  So, we're going to see how that works. -->




  <script>

    const pressed = [];

    // This is the secret code we're looking for (like "up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A"):
    const secretCode = 'wesbos'

    // Listen for the 'window.addEventListener'.
    // We're going to listen for the 'keyup' event.
    // And when this happens, we're going to run a function.
    window.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {
      // This is going to tell us the name of the key that was pressed: 'console.log(e.key)'.
      console.log(e.key);

      // Whenever someone presses a key,
      // we're going to push it into the 'pressed' array (see above).
      pressed.push(e.key);

      // And this is great, but the array can get vey large, because it's getting everything that's pressed.
      // So we want to trim this array to be the maximum that we would ever need.
      // And in our case, if we're just looking for the word 'wesbos' (the secret code - see above),
      // then at maximum, we are looking for 6 characters, since 'wesbos' has 6 characters.

      // So let's splice that.
      // And we want to start from counting from the back (the end) and go forward.
      // We don't want to start at the beginning.
      // So the way that we do that is we use negative, secret code: '-secretCode.length - 1'.
      // And this is going to - say we're looking for 6 letters - it's going to go from the back (starting with 's'), up 7 letters.

      // And then we're going to trim from there, which is going to be 'pressed.length',
      // which is the length of the array, minus 'secretCode': 'pressed.length - secretCode.length'.
      // And this will give us the exact number that we need.

      // So now in the browser, when we press the keys for 'wesbos', these 6 characters will be pushed into the array: ["w", "e", "s", "b", "o", "s"].
      // But as we continue pressing keys, remember that we want to start counting from the back of the array, and then trim from there,
      // because remember, we only want to have 6 elements in the array.
      // So as we continue typing, the first element of the array ("w") will be pushed out,
      // and the 7th key that was pressed will be added to the end of the array.
      // So, if we're keying "wesbos is cool", when we press the keys for "wesbos", we get ["w", "e", "s", "b", "o", "s"],
      // but as we continue typing, the first elements get pushed out of the array as the newer elements are pushed in through the back:
      // [ "e", "s", "b", "o", "s", "i" ] --> Here, we've keyed "wes bos i" --> the "w" is gone and the "i" has been added from the back.
      // [ "s", "b", "o", "s", "i", "s" ] --> Here, we've pressed "wesbos is"...
      // [ "b", "o", "s", "i", "s", "c" ] --> Here, we've typed "wesbos is c".
      // Etc.

      pressed.splice(-secretCode.length - 1, pressed.length - secretCode.length);
      console.log(pressed);

      // Now all that's left is for us to check if this array contains the secret code that we're looking for.
      // And remember that we have an array, so we need to use 'join('')' to turn it into a string.
      if (pressed.join('').includes(secretCode)) {
        // Here is where you add the code of what happens when the secret code has been correctly guessed.
        console.log("DIN DING DING!!!");

        // cornify.js (see top of code above)
        // There's a function called 'cornify_add()', and when you run it, it adds some random stuff to the browser (random unicorns).
        // Note that we've added a link to CORNIFY.JS to the HEAD of the HTML to be able to use it here.
        cornify_add();
      }
    })
