  <!-- Learning about Geolocation - not just getting the latitude and longitude of a geolocation.
  But there is also information that comes along with geolocation, and that is the heading,
  which essentially is like a compass. And it will tell us, for example, how many degrees of north is the person currently at.
  And it also will tell us the speed at which somebody is running.

  In Chrome, we can fake coordinates, but we cannot fake HEADING, and we cannot fake speed.
  Really, the only way to do this so far is with the iOS simulator (Mac).
  So, on Mac, go to XCode -> Open Developer Tool -> Simulator. Then you can change the hardware device.

  FIRST OFF
  You can not access someones Geolocation unless you're on a SECURE ORIGIN.
  And this hasn't been a problem for us (webcam and speech recognition project), because we did 'npm install' (which installs our BrowserSync),
  and then 'npm start' (so we go ahead and do 'npm install' and then 'npm start' now).
  That gives us a LOCAL HOST, which IS a secore origin.
  But because we want to open this up on a different device, it's going to give us an internal IP address (after we do 'npm start', we should see an IP address in the terminal of 'https://10.65.13.81:3000')
  And that is the address that we need to visit on our devices.

  Now, BrowserSync ships with what's called a 'self-signed certificate', which allows you to have HTTPS on your computer.
  It's still going to throw a warning in the browser, but that's because it's a self-signed certificate, and it doesn't trust it.
  So once you do 'npm start' and the page opens in the browser and you get the warning,
  you have to click 'Advanced', and you have to proceed to the LOCAL HOST in order to get that to work (i.e. click on 'Proceed to localhost (unsafe)').
  It's still going to cross us out, but that's standard for getting it working on your local computer.

  So what we want to do is copy that HTTPS in the terminal (see above) with the IP address of 'https://10.65.13.81:3000',
  Open up your Safari on your Simulator, and paste that URL in to visit that URL.
  And you'll get a warning saying it cannot verify the identity.
  Click on continue.
  Then, it's going to serve it over in a secure origin.
  Then, click on our file.
  When it asks if it can access your location, say Yes.

  So we've now gone to our Simulator.
  So go to Debug -> Location, and you can select a number of different jaunts.
  So it can simulate somebody running, having a bike ride at the Apple Campus, or a freeway drive.
  And it's going to simulate updating the location as well as the actual speed.
  That's why we need to use this iOS Simulator in here.
  So that's how it's going to work. -->

      // And it's giving us this geoposition. Inside of here, we have a timestamp as to when that happened,
      // as well as coordinates for when that happened.

      // We can also see 'heading', the number of degrees relative to North that we are.

      // and then speed (in kilometers per hour).

      speed.textContent = data.coords.speed;

      // Now we need to rotate the compass (which is our 'arrow' - see above), depending on where we are.
      // So we simply just take the arrow, and apply the CSS style 'transform', and it's going to be 'rotate(20deg)'.
      // But instead of rotating it 20 degrees, we want to rotate it 'data.coords.heading', which is the number of degrees relative North.
      // And it's already 360 base, so we don't have to do any math on that.

      // All the code above (from '(data)' to 'arrow.style.transform = `rotate(${data.coords.heading}deg)`') is called the SUCCESS CALLBACK.
      // So when somebody successfully gives you access to it, this will run.
      // But what happens if the user says no, and they do not give you access?
      // So, we need to run a new function, which is our error.
